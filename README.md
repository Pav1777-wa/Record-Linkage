# Record-Linkage
Record Linkage refers to the process of linking records from different data sources in the absence of unique identifiers. The purpose of 
record linkage is to improve data quality, integrity and to allow the existing data sources to be reused for the new study. It can 
provide new research opportunities as integrated data has more information as compared to a single dataset.
This project implements the record linkage process in python using various data manipulation/processing libraries.
The record linkage process consists of following five steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Blocking
3. Record Pair Comparison
4. Classification
5. Evaluation
